# Tetrahedra Into Diamonds

This repo is the recap of my internship at LIX (Ecole Polytechnique), supervised by Luca Castelli Aleardi (http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~amturing/).

We present in this repo a new compact data structure for tetrahedral meshes (volumic meshes). Our data structure is named Tetrahedra Into Diamonds and use on average 2.4rpt (references per tetrahedron), allows the navigation into the mesh in constant time and the computation of the hypersphere of a vertex in O(d).

All the code in this repo is native C++ code. No external library is used. For constructing our data structure, several steps must be followed : 

## Step 1 : Grouping the tetrahedra into diamonds 

## Step 2 : Creating diamonds

## Step 3 : Anchor the vertices to the diamonds/isolated tetrahedron and computing permutations

## Step 4 : Creating our data structure (an array of integer)
